arbitros, aestiment, and observe how the meaning of the Latin word helps
to make plain the meaning of the English.

Six hundred ships of the kind described above and twenty-eight war
vessels are built for Caesar. He orders thern to assemble at Portus Itius,
ready for the passage to Britain. He himself with four legions and eight
hundred horsemen invades the land of the Treveri, who have disregarded
