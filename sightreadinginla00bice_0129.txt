Caesar distrusts the Gauls, and when after the battle their representa-
tives come to him to make excuses, he has them arrested‚ and at once sets
out with the army for their camp. Before they know what is going on, he
storms their camp and inflicts on them fearful punishment. Because of the
trouble which the Germans keep causing him, Caesar determines to cross
the Rhine and attack them.
